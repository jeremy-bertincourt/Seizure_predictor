### Subject

This project is for 2016 Melbourne University Kaggle competition. The aim is to predict a human cerebral seizure from preictal (state before seizure) and interictal (state between seizures) data.

### How it works

The program uses the 4 main cerebral waves (delta to beta waves) and extracts features classified by the Xgboost library (based on GBT)
